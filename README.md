# Crypton-test-task

This is my first project that I wrote in Js and Solidity. It was written as a test assignment for admission to an internship at Crypton.

The project contains a smart contract, tasks for performing the functions prescribed in the smart contract, script to deploy it to rinkeby network and unit tests, that can be run through the solidity coverage plugin.


Tasks of smart contract:

- Donates money from an account whose private key is registered in hardhat.config.js
Use parameter --contract to specify which smart contract to donate to
Use parameter --amount to specify how much money you want to donate
```shell
npx hardhat donate
```
